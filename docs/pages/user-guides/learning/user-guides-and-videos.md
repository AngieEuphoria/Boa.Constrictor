Check out the user guides linked from the sidebar to the left
or the videos linked below to learn more about Boa Constrictor and the Screenplay Pattern.


## User Guides

The best way to start learning about Boa Constrictor and the Screenplay Pattern
is by watching the videos linked below
or taking the [tutorial]({{ "/tutorial/overview/" | relative_url }}).
Those resources, however, do not cover *everything* you can do with Boa Constrictor.

The **User Guides** provide additional documentation on Boa Constrictor's many facets.
The sidebar to the left provides links to user guides for various topics,
such as integrating Boa Constrictor with popular .NET test frameworks.
Each user guide is written to concisely cover one concern.
The collection of user guides together should provide comprehensive documentation
in a way that can easily scale as the project grows.



## Introduction to Boa Constrictor

This 32-minute video introduces Boa Constrictor as the .NET Screenplay Pattern.
It walks through limitations with other patterns, the Screenplay Pattern's design, and how to make Screenplay calls with Boa Constrictor.
It's a great video to watch if you are new to Boa Constrictor.

## Converting a SpecFlow Project

Boa Constrictor's Screenplay calls can easily replace raw WebDriver calls, page objects, and other patterns in existing test automation projects.
In this 2-hour livestream,
[Andreas Willich](https://twitter.com/SabotageAndi) and
[Pandy Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda)
converted a SpecFlow project to use Boa Constrictor:
